<html><body>Old Man:<br>
I think you've noticed that my son is no longer of this world. He died in the battle that gave the Fields of Massacre their name. Back then the army of Elmore, desperate to avoid defeat, unleashed a terrible poison that doomed their enemies to a life after death. Ever since then, my son has been appearing here as a ghost. He likes to pester adventurers that are passing by, but he means no harm. And to think that he had his entire life in front of him... Well, you can't change the past. I hope that after hearing this story you will forgive my son's insolence.
