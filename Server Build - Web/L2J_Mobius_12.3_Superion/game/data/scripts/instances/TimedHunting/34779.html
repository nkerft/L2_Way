<html><body>Priestess of Light Nerea:<br>
May Einhasad's light shine upon you...<br>
Greetings! I am Nerea, a humble servant of Einhasad. I am the leader of the Priests of Light.<br>
Can you feel it? This place is full of some strange energy. It is no longer the Tower of Insolence that I used to know.<br>
The Church has sent the Priests of Light here to determine what has happened. But we have run into some difficulties.<br>
We could really use your help.
