<html><body>Manager of Party Instance Zones Benusta:<br>
You cannot enter this instance zone now.<br>
If you're visiting the instance zone for the first time, your party leader has to talk to me. There is no other way to enter.<br>
Keep in mind that a party cannot move to an instance zone if someone from it does not meet the level requirements. Also, teleportation will be impossible if any of the party members stands too far from me or is currently performing augmentation.<br>
It is also impossible to enter an instance zone if one of the party members is already in another zone. Please, check all the requirements again.
