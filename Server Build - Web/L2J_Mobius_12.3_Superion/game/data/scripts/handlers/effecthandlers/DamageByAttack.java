/**
 * An effect that changes damage taken from an attack.<br>
 * The retail implementation seems to be altering whatever damage is taken after the attack has been done and not when attack is being done.<br>
 * Exceptions for this effect appears to be DOT effects and terrain damage, they are unaffected by this stat.<br>
 * As for example in retail this effect does reduce reflected damage taken (because it is received damage), as well as it does not decrease reflected damage done,<br>
 * because reflected damage is being calculated with the original attack damage and not this altered one.<br>
 * Multiple values of this effect add-up to each other rather than multiplying with each other. Be careful, there were cases in retail where damage is deacreased to 0.
