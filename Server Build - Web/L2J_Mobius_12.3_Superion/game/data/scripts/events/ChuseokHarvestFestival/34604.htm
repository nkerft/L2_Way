<html><body>Happy holiday, traveler!<br>
Have you seen this huge moon on Giran Square? I look at it an think that the specks on the moon are similar in shape to... a carrot. What do they remind you of?<br>
Imagine, there is a belief that the dark markings on the near side of the moon are a giant rabbit that cooks rice cakes. And if you look at the moon and you see the outline of such a rabbit, then you need to make a wish right away, because it will certainly come true.<br>
*rabbit laughs*<br>
Ha! To be honest, I'm terribly bad at cooking, but I love making others happy. If suddenly you have a Wish Ticket, then I will exchange it for supplies that will definitely come in handy on your travels. How do I get a ticket? Look at the moon and make a wish!<br>
